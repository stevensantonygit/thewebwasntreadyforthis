# The Web Wasn't Ready For This!
*A chaotic, confusing, and possibly cursed website that tests the limits of what HTML, CSS, and way-too-much JavaScript can do. Each day, I‚Äôll add a new ‚Äúfeature‚Äù that pushes the site further into glorious nonsense: animated buttons that run away from your mouse, pages that gaslight you, shopping carts for things you can‚Äôt buy, and more.
This is not a helpful website. This is not a beautiful website. This is a journey. And the web‚Ä¶ well, the web wasn‚Äôt ready for this.*

## üöÄ Features
- **Day 1: The Impossible Button**: *A button that actively avoids your cursor, mocks you when you miss, and celebrates if you somehow manage to click it.*
- **Day 2: Text That Runs Away**: *Paragraphs of text that scatter in different directions when you try to read them. The longer you try to focus on a sentence, the faster it moves away. If you stop moving your cursor, it slowly returns to normal position.*
- **Day 3: Form From Hell**: *A sign-up form where:
Fields randomly rearrange themselves while typing.
Password requirements change every 5 seconds.
Autocomplete suggests the worst possible options.
The submit button has a fake loading animation that never completes.*
- **Day 4: The Indecisive Checkbox**: *A terms & conditions checkbox that:
Unchecks itself randomly.
Sometimes checks itself when you didn't click it.
Toggles between checked/unchecked when you hover over other elements.
Displays increasingly desperate messages begging you to check/uncheck it.*
- **Day 5: Cookie Consent Nightmare**: *A cookie consent popup that:
Multiplies every time you try to close it.
Gets increasingly smaller when you refuse.
Follows your cursor like a swarm.
Has incredibly verbose legal text that somehow changes meaning each time you read it.*
- **Day 6: The Gaslighting Website**: *Elements that subtly change when you're not looking:
Text that changes slightly between page views.
Background color that shifts imperceptibly over time.
Images that look normal but slowly rotate.
Navigation links that go to different places each time.*
- **Day 7: Aggressive Parallax**: *Scrolling experience where:
Elements move at wildly different speeds.
Things occasionally scroll in the opposite direction.
Random elements zoom toward your cursor.
Scrolling sometimes accelerates uncontrollably.*
- **Day 8: The Phantom Shopping Cart**: *A shopping experience where:
You can add items that don't exist.
Cart randomly adds/removes products.
Prices fluctuate while browsing.
Checkout button leads to a 404 page with a sad face.*
- **Day 9: Cursor Chaos**: *Custom cursor behaviors including:
Multiple fake cursors that follow your real cursor with delay.
Cursor that leaves a permanent trail of smaller cursors.
Cursor that occasionally "sneezes," scattering tiny cursor particles.
Elements that are repelled by or attracted to your cursor like magnets.*
- **Day 10: The Ultimate Finale**: *When clicked, it reveals a perfectly normal, boring website with a message: "Congratulations, you've survived The Web Wasn't Ready For This!"*
