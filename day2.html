  <div class="instructions">Try to read the text below... if you can!</div>
  
  <div class="content-container">
    <p class="runaway-text">This is a normal paragraph that you might want to read. It contains some interesting information about the nature of the universe and the human condition. Unfortunately, it doesn't want to be read.</p>
    
    <p class="runaway-text">Web design has always been about usability and accessibility. This website proudly ignores those principles in favor of chaos and confusion. Why make things easy when they can be impossible?</p>
    
    <p class="runaway-text">Did you know that the average person spends about 7 hours looking at screens each day? After experiencing this website, you might want to reconsider your screen time habits and go touch some grass.</p>
    
    <p class="runaway-text">The more you try to focus on this text, the more it will resist your attempts. It's like trying to catch a soap bubble or hold onto a dream after waking up. Some things aren't meant to be captured.</p>
    
    <p class="runaway-text">If you've managed to read this far, you're either incredibly persistent or you've discovered the secret: the text only runs when you move your cursor. Stay perfectly still, and the words might just behave themselves.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="secret-message">Congratulations! You've discovered that the text calms down if you stop moving your cursor. Patience defeats chaos.</div>
